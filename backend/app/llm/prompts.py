- Do not invent facts or add details that are not present.

Existing keywords (JSON array):

Task:
1) Infer up to {top_n} short keywords/phrases from the question (lowercase, 1-3 words).
2) For each existing keyword, compare it to the inferred question keywords and rate their relatedness on a 1-10 scale:
   - 1 = no relation
   - 10 = synonyms / same concept
3) Select matches where relatedness is 8 or higher.

Rules:
- Output keywords MUST be items from the existing list.
- Do NOT return broad or loosely related terms.
- Return JSON only with:
  - matches: array of objects {{"keyword": "<existing keyword>", "score": <1-10>, "question_keyword": "<best-matching question keyword>"}}
  - keywords: array of matched existing keywords (score >= 8)
Example: {{"matches":[{{"keyword":"wedding","score":9,"question_keyword":"love"}}],"keywords":["wedding"]}}
